### **2. Key Endpoints and Outcomes**
- **Efficacy (Survival, Progression, etc.)**:
  - Overall survival (OS) was a primary endpoint in many submissions, such as:
    - **Keytruda + Chemotherapy (IQWiG, Germany)**: Significant OS advantage demonstrated in KEYNOTE-355.
    - **Fulvestrant + Verzenios (G-BA, Germany)**: OS data from MONARCH 2 and MONARCH plus.
  - Progression-free survival (PFS) was often included but debated for its patient relevance (e.g., **G-BA assessments** for Kisqali and Fulvestrant + Verzenios).
  - Time to first subsequent chemotherapy was included in some submissions but often critiqued for methodological limitations (e.g., **Fulvestrant + Verzenios (G-BA, Germany)**).
- **Morbidity and Symptoms**:
  - Symptom scales such as EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 were used in several submissions (e.g., **Keytruda + Chemotherapy (IQWiG, Germany)**), but results often showed no significant added benefit.
- **Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)**:
  - Instruments like EQ-5D and EORTC QLQ-C30 were used but often yielded inconclusive or exploratory results (e.g., **Enhertu (HAS, France)** and **Keytruda + Chemotherapy (IQWiG, Germany)**).
- **Safety and Adverse Events**:
  - Safety profiles were extensively analyzed, with some drugs showing disadvantages in side effects (e.g., **Keytruda + Chemotherapy (IQWiG, Germany)**: gastrointestinal disorders, diarrhea, dysgeusia).
